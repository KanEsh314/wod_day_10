Wod day 10

A prime is a natural number greater than  that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given p integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is Prime or Not prime on a new line.

Note: If possible, try to come up with an o(/n) (square root n) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you can come up with for an O(n) algorithm. 

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,p , denoting the number of integers to check for primality. 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains an integer,n , you must test for primality.

Constraints

Output Format

For each integer, print whether  is Prime or Not prime on a new line.

Sample Input

3
12
5
7
Sample Output

Not prime
Prime
Prime
Explanation

We check the following  integers for primality:

3 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
5 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
